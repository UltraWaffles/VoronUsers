my ender switchwire

The goal of this build is to convert your ender 3 (original version) to a switchwire without changing the design too much.

![overview](https://github.com/UltraWaffles/Voron-Switchwire/blob/master/Mods/UltraWaffles/Images/Fusion360_icWbvkmAlb.png)

Things to note:
1. This build can work with the ender 3 pro (I have not tested this, as I dont have an ender 3 pro)
2. You only have to cut 1 extrusion by yourself (gotta tap one yourself also, unless theres a different way u can mount extrusions)
3. You have to buy a few extrusions (they dont have to be from misumi)
4. This design is made for 2020/2040 extrusions
5. You will be using alot of parts from the original ender 3
6. I have a BoM for all the parts you need
7. Hammerhead tnuts works just as well as those expensive sliding ones.
8. if you buy shorter M4 flathead screws, you can reduce the height of the bed, thus creating more z height.
9. This version allows you to enclose it without any problems
10. For now, the screen and door panel conflicts with each other, Ill fix it when I find a solution
11. Not sure if im allowed to do this, but all of the files (execpt for electronic mounts) are in the stls.rar file
